# Gradient Descent - Boston Dataset
Boston dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.
We are given a Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data. The task is to come up with Gradient Descent algorithm and thus predictions for the test dataset given.
<br><br>The task is to: <br>
1. Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions. <br>
2. Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations. <br>
3. Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results. <br>
